- Hi, I’m @Tropolopolo and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Arlington.
- I’m interested in game development, audio programming, video processing, artificial intelligence, amongst other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity 3d game engine (implied C#), secure programming, and how software is developed professionally.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller projects that don't take a lot of time away from school and work since I am already stretched for time.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email - matthewirvine1999@gmail.com, add your username and where you got my email from (Add 'saw you on github' or something).
- * if I don't respond I am either too busy to be of any help, or I am not interested.
